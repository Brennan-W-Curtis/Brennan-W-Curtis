# Hello, I'm Brennan!

## A Front-End Web Developer passionate about creating interactive experiences.

I love challenging myself by creating applications with experiences that are informative, responsive, and accessible. With each project I strive to learn and refine my skills with the latest web technologies.

- I'm a recent graduate and proud alumni of [Juno College](https://junocollege.com/).

- Here's a video of me demonstrating a project I made during my enrollment, [Neuromancy](https://www.loom.com/share/1ef21907fc6145c6bea4fb34b591fd81). 

- If you're curious about my work please check out my [portfolio](https://www.brennan-w-curtis.com/)!

- Currently I'm working on refining my skills with JavaScript (ES6+), React, Firebase, and API integrations.

- My resume can be found [here](https://www.brennan-w-curtis.com/assets/downloads/Brennan-W-Curtis-Resume.pdf).
